American Foxhound

Bred specifically to hunt in packs, the American Foxhound is a scenthound that is rarely kept as a pet. In its early days its prey was the native grey fox until the later importation of the European red fox. On the hunt this breed will ignore any other prey such as deer, raccoon or rabbit, staying focused on the fox.
