Before developing as a gundog the Labrador Retriever was kept by fisherman. They were used to bring fish-laden nets back to the shore by either swimming out to the net or by jumping off boats. As a retriever it brings back shot birds from both land and water when hunting. Although many gundogs can retrieve, the category of retrievers are more specialized at the task of finding drowned waterfowl. Today the Labrador is an extremely popular companion and holds the highest registrations in both the United States and United Kingdom.
