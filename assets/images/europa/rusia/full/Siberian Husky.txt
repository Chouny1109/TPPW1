Siberian Husky

The Siberian Husky is the smallest and fastest of the sled dogs, built for carrying light loads at high speeds. It is believed that the name ‘husky’ is derived either from Europeans mispronouncing ‘chukchi’ or as a slang abbreviation of ‘eskimo.’ During WWII the Siberian Husky was heavily used in the Arctic Circle by the United States military for search and rescue.
