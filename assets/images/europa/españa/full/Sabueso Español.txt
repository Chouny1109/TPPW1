Spanish Hound
Sabueso Espa単ol

The Sabueso Espa単ol is a scenthound that was developed to hunt a variety of both large and small game in mountainous areas. They normally work singly with their hunter rather than in packs. Originally used for large game such as bears, boars, and wolves, as this game grew scarce they were adapted to hunt rabbits. Today the large game population has increased and this has returned to the use of the Sabueso Espa単ol on boar hunts.
