English Cocker Spaniel

The English Cocker Spaniel is a spaniel, which is a flushing dog. They search for game birds, which in turn panic when found and appear for the waiting hunter. Once the prey has been shot they will retrieve the birds on command. Their name comes from the birds they most often hunted, the woodcock, moorecook (red grouse), and heathercock (black grouse).
