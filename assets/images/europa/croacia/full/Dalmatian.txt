Dalmatian
The Dalmatian is one of the most recognized of all breeds due to their distinctive spotted coat. They are the English Coach Dog or Carriage Dog, the only breed that traditionally alongside horse-drawn vehicles. Their affinity for horses and instinct for this task is so ingrained that an adolescent will fall in behind a carriage with no training. Early dogs had their ears cropped away and were fitted with studded collars, giving them a fierce look as their main duty was protection of its people and their goods. Later, their presence became more a status symbol as they remained trotting alongside their charges. When the breed arrived in the United States it became intertwined with horse-drawn fire wagons. To this day they are often kept at stations as mascots even though the horses were long ago replaced by motorized engines.
