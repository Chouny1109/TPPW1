Shetland Sheepdog
Shetland Sheepdog
The Shetland Sheepdog was developed to herd sheep, which it was capable of doing even without human supervision. It is said that in earlier days they were taken with their charges to one small island or another that was uninhabited to find better grazing. The flocks were left with only the dogs in charge until their owners returned. As a secondary task they would also bring the cows home at milking time. Today they are more commonly kept as companions, although some are still used for herding.
