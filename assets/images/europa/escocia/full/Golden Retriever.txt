Golden Retriever

The Golden Retriever was originally developed as a gundog. Retrievers are used to bring back shot birds from both land and water to their waiting hunter. Although many gundogs can retrieve, the category of retrievers are more specialized at the task of finding drowned waterfowl. Today the Golden Retriever is a widely popular companion, assisting the blind and disabled, and some still work in the field as gundogs.
