Brazilian Mastiff

The Brazilian Mastiff was originally bred as all purpose working dogs on plantations. On the hunt they were capable of tracking, attacking and holding the prey (most often jaguars) until their hunter arrived to make the kill. The 'fila' in its name is derived from a Portuguese word meaning 'to hold/secure'. Other tasks included controlling cattle by grabbing them by the ear and working as a property guard. Unfortunately, the Brazilian Mastiff has been used for dog and pit fighting making it banned in several countries as a dangerous breed.
