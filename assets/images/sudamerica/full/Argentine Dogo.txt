Argentine Dogo


The Argentine Dogo is a large scenthound that was bred specifically to hunt big game such as wild boar, puma and jaguar. Their job is to track the prey in silence, attack and corner it, and then hold the quarry at bay until the hunter could arrive and make the kill. Their secondary roles, particularly in their homeland, include property guarding, search and rescue, police work, and therapy dog.
