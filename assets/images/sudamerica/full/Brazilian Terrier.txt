Brazilian Terrier

The Brazilian Terrier has only recently begun to find a place in our world as a companion breed, but it has been a common sight on ranchers in its homeland for over 100 years. As a working dog they are ratters, hunters and watch dogs. Although small, these dogs are more alert than their heavy sleeping large companions - the Brazilian Mastiff, who once awaken by the terrier's barks can deal with any intruder. As a hunter they work in packs that work together to exhaust small prey such as armadillos, guinea pigs and quail.
