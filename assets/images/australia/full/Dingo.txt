Dingo

The Dingo is first and foremost a wild animal. Some have been kept as companions although this is highly controversial. The legality of owning a Dingo as a pet varies from state to state within Australia. Previously the Australian National Kennel Council had a written breed standard for the Dingo. However, it appears to have been removed from their classifications.
