Australian Cattle Dog

â€‹The Australian Cattle Dog is a herding breed that was developed for driving and controlling cattle by nipping at their heels. However, they can be used with other livestock such as horses and goats. They are silent workers, a trait gained from their Dingo ancestry, which helps prevent panic in the herd. Today they remain extremely popular with farmers and ranchers worldwide.
