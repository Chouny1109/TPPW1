Smithfield
Smithfield Collie, Smithfield Sheepdog
Australian Cattle Dog
The Smithfield is more a type of dog, rather than a breed. They are named after the Smithfield Market in London where farmers sold their livestock. Most authors online and in publications list these dogs as extinct. However, there are several working lines in New Zealand and Australia, particularly in Tasmania. As these dogs are bred on farms and homesteads, they do not all conform to a true breed. Nor is there enough interest to have them fully recognized.

Primarily a sheepdog, the Smithfield can be used with cattle and other livestock. They also make excellent companions.
