Australian Terrier
The Australian Terrier was developed as a working farm terrier to control vermin such as rats, rabbits, and poisonous snakes. They are fearless against serpents, dispatching them in a leap and twist attack from behind.

Today the Australian Terrier primarily lives out a less thrilling life as a companion and show dog. They were the first Australian breed to receive international recognition by The Kennel Club in 1933.
