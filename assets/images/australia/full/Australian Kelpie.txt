Australian Kelpie
The Australian Kelpie is a herding breed that originated in Australia. They were bred to work with sheep having little or no guidance. Which made them highly prized among farmers and ranchers. It is said that these dogs can cover as much as 30 miles a day, keeping track of thousands of animals. In close quarters Kelpies will run over the backs of sheep when they are huddled together rather than around them. Today they have been imported throughout the world and their charges have expanded to include cattle, goats, ducks, chickens, and other livestock.

The name ‘Kelpie’ was given to a black and tan female puppy in the early 1870s, after the Scottish water spirit. It stuck and eventually Australian collies became Australian Kelpies.

In Australia there are two types of recognized Kelpies, the Working Kelpie and Show Kelpie. The Show variety, bred for conformation, is more limited in colors and is often heavier. While the Working is bred solely for its ability to herd.
