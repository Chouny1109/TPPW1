Tenterfield Terrier
The Tenterfield Terrier descends from terriers originally used to eliminate pests such as rat and snakes on farms and homesteads. Today it they are kept almost exclusively as companions and show dogs. It is rarely seen outside of Australia and New Zealand.

The name ‘Tenterfield’ is taken from a location in New South Wales. These dogs were not first developed there, but it is where they were commonly bred.
