Chow Chow
The Chow Chow originated in China where it has been called Songshi Quan, which translates to “puffy-lion dog”. There is debate surrounding the origin of their modern name. Some say it comes from an old pidgin-English expression used to cover all items in a ship’s cargo, basically 'etcetera'. Others suggest that 'chow' is derived from the Cantonese word for 'edible'.
 
Once a multi-purposed working breed, the Chow Chow was used as a guard, cart puller, hunter, and even as food. Unfortunately, their meat was considered a delicacy, and in some places it still is. As a hunting breed it worked both alone and in packs. These packs could number into hundreds of dogs. Today it is kept almost exclusively as a companion dog.
