Pug

​Like many toy dogs, the Pug has always been kept solely as a companion. There are several theories regarding the origin of its name. It may come from the Latin word ‘pungus’ meaning ‘fist’ or the old English word ‘pug’, meaning ‘anything tenderly loved’. ‘Pug’ has also in turn meant ‘monkey’ or ‘hobgoblin/imp’.
