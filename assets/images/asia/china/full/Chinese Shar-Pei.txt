Chinese Shar-Pei
The Chinese Shar-Pei is a breed of dog that originates from China. Their name translates to “sandy skin”, an obvious reference to this breed's unique coat. Once kept as a general farm dog, they guarded livestock, protected the home, and were used for hunting. Their wrinkles kept them protected from large prey such as boar, wolf, and tiger. In later centuries they were used for dog fighting, often against each other. Today they are kept primarily as companions, although some are still used for protection.
 
In China there is a second variety known as the Bone-Mouth Shar-Pei. These dogs have far less wrinkles and are slimmer and more fit than their more common counterparts. The Bone-Mouth is considered to be the original Shar-Pei before its wrinkles were exaggerated by western breeders. Unfortunately, the Bone-Mouth is not accepted by any major kennel club, which has led to a decrease in their numbers.
