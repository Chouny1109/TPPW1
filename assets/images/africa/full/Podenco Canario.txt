Podenco Canario
The Podenco Canario, belongs to the family of primitive sighthounds found throughout the Mediterranean. It includes the Cirneco dell’Etna, Ibizan Hound, Pharaoh Hound, and the Portuguese Podengos.
​
The term ‘sighthound’ is a bit misleading as the Podenco Canario uses sight, scent, and hearing while hunting. Much of its homeland is an uneven volcanic terrain, and it is adept at locating hidden prey in rock crevices and thorny bushes. The Podenco Canario’s main prey is rabbit and hare, although it can be used for any small game.
