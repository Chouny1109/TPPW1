â€‹The Africanis (an abbreviation of African Canis) is a primitive dog from South Africa. Their Swahili name is umbwa wa ki-shenzi, which translates to 'common or traditional dog'. Each region has its own unique type, making it impossible to conform them to a specific standard. Although not a breed in the traditional sense, they have bred true to type for centuries. This makes them one of the few remaining dogs that are genetically closest to the earliest domestication of the dog. They are closest in relation to other ancient breeds such as the Dingo, Carolina Dog, and New Guinea Singing Dog.
