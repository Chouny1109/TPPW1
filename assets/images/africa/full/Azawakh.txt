Azawakh
​
​The Azawakh is a sighthound that is kept by the Tuareg nomads in the Sahel region of Africa. There it is called the Idii n' Illeli, which translates to 'sighthound of the free people'. Its main prey are gazelle, mouflon (wild sheep), and hare. It can pursue animals at speeds nearing 40 miles per hour. They begin their training at three months of age by chasing rats before graduating to hares.

When taken on a hunt the Azawakh are carried across the saddles of camels with their masters, only released when prey is sighted. This allows them to conserve their energy as a chase may take up to five hours to complete. Unlike most sighthounds the Azawakh has been bred to hunt in packs, chasing the animal until it is too tired to continue fleeing.

As a secondary role the Azawakh is bred for protection. Guarding its owners, the encampment, and flocks from invaders such as predators and thieves. Even today it is not uncommon to see them sleeping on the straw roofs of village homes. When one dog senses danger it will jump down, alerting the others. This causes the dogs to form a pack and as a single force they will attack or drive off the predator or intruder.
